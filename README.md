`valet_parking` provides the service of parking your threads.

This library provides a cross-platform abstraction for thread parking which only needs one `AtomicUsize`
to operate on, and is `no_std`-compatible.

## Overview

Two patterns:
- `Waiters`: multiple threads can wait on a single `AtomicUsize` until one thread wakes them all up at once.
- `Parker`: One thread parkes itself, and multiple threads or a timeout are able to wake it up.

`valet` has two primary goals:
- Offer a cross-platform abstraction for thread parking.
- Be usable in other libraries that offer `no_std` support, even without `alloc`.

Some systems provide a way to park a thread while requiring nothing more than a single atomic. Other systems need multiple variables. The generic Posix implementation is such an example, it requires a condvar with mutex. `valet` is able to offer an API that requires only an `AtomicUsize` thanks to one key observation: we can use the stack of a parked thread to store the extra fields.

This does however takes some extra care on the side of `valet` to ensure no thread does reads from the stack of a thread while it is getting unparked.

The goal to provide an API that can be used without allocations has a big impact on the design of `valet`. Take the generic Posix implementation as an example. It requires a condvar with a mutex for thread parking. If `valet` were to provide some `ThreadParker` type containing fields for these two, you would have to store it in some place in memory that is accessable to both threads. This would typically be an `Arc`, or some other structure requring an allocation.

Instead `valet` provides an API that only requires you to pass around a reference to an `AtomicUsize`.
In the case were multiple variables are required
